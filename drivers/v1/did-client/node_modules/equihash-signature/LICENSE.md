All rights reserved.

Summary
=======

This license allows the licensee to use Bedrock and its software modules
for non-commercial purposes such as self-study, research, personal
projects, or for evaluation purposes. If the licensee uses Bedrock
directly or indirectly to generate revenue, or to provide products or
services to more than 500 people (users), the licensee must immediately
obtain a non-profit or commercial license.

Examples
========

These are examples of cases that are allowed by this license:

* The licensee is an individual that creates Bedrock-dependent software for
  personal use only.
* The licensee is an individual or group of students/researchers that uses
  Bedrock to experiment with an idea for a non-commercial project.
* The licensee is a startup company that prototypes a Bedrock-dependent
  product before they have cash flow and will be testing the prototype
  software with less than 500 users. The service will not generate revenue
  of any kind.
* The licensee is a for-profit organization that creates a product or
  service that is used by less than 500 users and is built with or
  integrates with Bedrock. The service must be exclusively provided for free
  and no parent, subsidiary, agent, or affiliate organization may profit
  from its use.

These cases require a non-profit or commercial license:

  Bedrock-dependent service.
